### Welcome on my Github profile !

Current projects:

- **[Fil](https://github.com/Fil-Language)**: a programmation language. Currently I work on the compiler made with Antlr and LLVM.
- **[Marmotte](https://github.com/Marmotte-Framework)**: a php framework to replace Fork and then use it for my website and several other projects.

Finished projects (finished as far as I can, some are still on work):

- A **[Logger](https://github.com/Gashmob/Logger)** made in several languages (Java, Kotlin, C, C++, Python, Go). It uses the same principle for each targets.
- **[Fork](https://github.com/Gashmob/Fork)** a php framework to create websites. Currently I use it for my [personal website](https://ktraini.com).
- **[CodeShare](https://github.com/Gashmob/CodeShare)** a code sharing website. There are already too many, so why not one more?
- **[Enquirer](https://github.com/Gashmob/Enquirer)**: An interactive CLI library in C++, inspired by the same name javascript library [Enquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/enquirer).
