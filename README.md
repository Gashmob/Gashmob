### Welcome on my Github profile !

I'm a 3rd year student at Ensimag in the Information Systems Engineering sector. Currently I'm at Chalmers University in Gothenburg, Sweden as part of the international mobility of Ensimag.

Finished projects (finished as far as I can, some are still on work):

- **[RandomSentence](https://github.com/TP-TD-Informatique/RandomSentence)** an android app made as part of a lab on the subject of *random lists*. This app use a little program that I've made [Sentence Generator](https://github.com/Gashmob/Sentence-Generator).
- A **[Logger](https://github.com/Gashmob/Logger)** made in several languages (Java, Kotlin, C, C++, Python, Go). It still uses the same principle.
- **[Feeljob](https://github.com/Gashmob/Feeljob)** a website for connecting job seekers and companies but also between individuals and self-employed people. This is my first project for a client as part of a university module.
- **[Fork](https://github.com/Gashmob/Fork)** a php framework to create websites. Imagined from Symfony, there is still a lot of work to be able to use it for large sites. Currently I use it for my [personal website](https://ktraini.com).
- **[CodeShare](https://github.com/Gashmob/CodeShare)** a code sharing website. There are already too many, so why not one more?

Current projects:

- **[Fil](https://github.com/Fil-Language)**: a programmation language. A documentation is already available in french. Currently I work on the compiler made with Antlr and LLVM.
- **[AVOW](https://github.com/Gashmob/AVOW)**: a cli for simple image treatment. In brief it's a collection of image treatment algorithms.
- **[Enquirer](https://github.com/Gashmob/Enquirer)**: An interactive CLI library, inpired by the same name javascript library [Enquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/enquirer).
- **Beaver**: An alternative to Thunderbird, I'm on the designing phase, so there is still no git.

A few sentences that I wanted to place:
- `They didn't know it was impossible, so they did it`
- `If it doesn't fit, it's not the box that's too narrow, it's your mind`
- `Why think when you can dream?`
- `Logic is illogical as long as it is logical`
- `Happiness is not only about being happy, but also about making people happy`
