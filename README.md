### Welcome on my Github profile !

I'm a 3rd year student at Ensimag in the Information Systems Engineering sector. Currently I'm at Chalmers University in Gothenburg, Sweden as part of the international mobility of Ensimag.

Finished projects:
- **[RandomSentence](https://github.com/TP-TD-Informatique/RandomSentence)** an android app made as part of a lab on the subject of *random lists*. This app use a little program that I've made [Sentence Generator](https://github.com/Gashmob/Sentence-Generator).
- A **[Logger](https://github.com/Gashmob/Logger)** made in several languages (Java, Kotlin, C, C++, Python, Go). It still uses the same principle.
- **[Feeljob](https://github.com/Gashmob/Feeljob)** a website for connecting job seekers and companies but also between individuals and self-employed people. This is my first project for a client as part of a university module.
- **[Fork](https://github.com/Gashmob/Fork)** a php framework to create websites. Imagined from Symfony, there is still a lot of work to be able to use it for large sites. Currently I use it for my [personal website](https://ktraini.com).
- **[CodeShare](https://github.com/Gashmob/CodeShare)** a code sharing website. There are already too many, so why not one more?

Current projects:
- **MyRestAPI**: a web application that allows you to create, configure and share REST APIs. The result is a json file which is then passed to a command line tool (cli) which generates all the API code with documentation and tests. The documentation is also accessible directly from the web application.
- **[Fil](https://github.com/Fil-Language)**: a programmation language. A documentation is already available in french. Currently I work on the compiler made with Antlr and LLVM.

A few sentences that I wanted to place:
- `They didn't know it was impossible, so they did it`
- `If it doesn't fit, it's not the box that's too narrow, it's your mind`
- `Why think when you can dream?`
- `Logic is illogical as long as it is logical`
- `Happiness is not only about being happy, but also about making people happy`
