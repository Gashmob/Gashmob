### Welcome on my Github profile !

I'm a 3rd year student at Ensimag in the Information Systems Engineering sector. Currently I'm at Chalmers University in Gothenburg, Sweden as part of the international mobility of Ensimag.

Finished projects (finished as far as I can, some are still on work):

- A **[Logger](https://github.com/Gashmob/Logger)** made in several languages (Java, Kotlin, C, C++, Python, Go). It still uses the same principle.
- **[Fork](https://github.com/Gashmob/Fork)** a php framework to create websites. Currently I use it for my [personal website](https://ktraini.com).
- **[CodeShare](https://github.com/Gashmob/CodeShare)** a code sharing website. There are already too many, so why not one more?
- **[Enquirer](https://github.com/Gashmob/Enquirer)**: An interactive CLI library in C++, inspired by the same name javascript library [Enquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/enquirer).

Current projects:

- **[Fil](https://github.com/Fil-Language)**: a programmation language. A documentation is already available in french. Currently I work on the compiler made with Antlr and LLVM.

A few sentences that I wanted to place:
- `They didn't know it was impossible, so they did it`
- `Why think when you can dream?`
- `Logic is illogical as long as it is logical`
- `Happiness is not only about being happy, but also about making people happy`
